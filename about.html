		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I love going hiking! Being with nature always seem to free my mind and let me <br>
		feel free. I enjoy taking pictures. The way you can capture so many words<br>
		within an image astounds me. I like recording videos and taking<br>
		timelapses, the ability to record progress over time is invaluable.</p>
