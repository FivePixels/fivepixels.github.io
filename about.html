      <h1>About Me</h1>
	  </h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
       My name is Dylan Bolger. I'm a 20 year old college student that likes to dabble into the world of code. I'm a junior at Missouri State University. To best describe me, you'll more than likely see me at my desk working on something on my computer. Since I was young, I've always been interested in the internet and technology as it has evolved. Gaming was a great start and continues to exist in my day to day life. As I've grown older, I've found interest in creating software for the world. Being involved with technology is one of my favorite things to do. I hope my projects inspire creativity, and help educate students learning to program and create software of their own.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
		Gaming, as mentioned earlier in my introduction, has always been one of my favorite things. I also enjoy taking occasional hiking trips to distance myself from technology and take time to slow down. I listen to music quite a bit while on my machine. I also enjoy partaking in political discussions and debates with friends. On a warm day, you might see me skateboarding. Sometimes, I'll play hacker with my phone and mess around with jailbreaking.
